# OverTheWire Bandit - Level 0 & 0-1 

## The Objective :
The task is to find the password in order to progress to the next level. I am told the password for the next level is stored in a file called `readme` located in the home directory.

---

## Solution:

## 1: Connect to Server
I used SSH to connect to the OverTheWire Bandit server. This allows us to securely access and manage remote systems over an unsecured network. The username provided is `bandit0` and the port is `2220`. The `-p` option is used to specify the port.

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

I was prompted for a password. The password was `bandit0`. This allowed me to enter the server.

## 2: List files in directory
Next, `ls` coomand will be used to identify the files present. The file present was `readme`. I then used the `cat readme` to show contents.

```bash
ls
```

### The output:

```bash
readme
```

### 3: Display contents of `readme`file
We will now use the `cat readme` to show contents of the file. This will contain the password.

```bash
cat readme
```

### The output:

```bash
